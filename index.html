      <i>
          I am studying computer engineering at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca, where my passion for technology and problem-solving has flourished. Over the past two years, I have worked at Accesa IT Systems as a Junior ServiceNow Engineer, where I extended my skills in IT service management and automation. This experience gave me a chance to gain hands on experience in configuring and optimizing ServiceNow solutions and working in a large company. I am driven by a deep curiosity for emerging technologies and their potential to transform industries. As I continue my educational journey and professional growth, I aspire to make a meaningful impact in the field of computer engineering and contribute to innovative solutions that drive positive change.
